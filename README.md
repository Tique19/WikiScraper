# WikiScraper
a Wikipedia Web Scraper

This code iterates through a list of wikipedia tags in order to parse and scrape various types of data on America's 20 most populous citie from the information on the wikipedia page. Specifically the name, state, latitude, longitude, time zone, population, total area, demonyms, notable educational institutions, and the local MLB baseball team, if any. In addition to the data provided by the wikipedia page, both the sportsreference and openweathermap api's were implemented to document which cities were hosting a baseball game and the weather for that day in hopes of informing a potential patron on whether or not to buy a ticket to a game in the city they are in.
